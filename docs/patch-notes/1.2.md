# Release 1.2 - V2 Delta Archives

This release introduces a new implementation of the archiving process which provides
a few benefits over the older archives. Here's a list of what have changed:

- ...
- (`ADDED`) **New Menu Options**: "Open Data Directory" and "Open Game Directory".
  Does what is says on the tin. Provides you with a quick access to the BSK app files
  or the game files.
- (`FIXED`) **Song Explorer _(Beta)_ couldn't delete levels when a preview has been
  played once**. The level would not show up in the listing anymore but the map's audio
  file would still exist on this. (This is also observable in the log file where it would
  warn about directories not being valid levels.)
- (`FIXED`) **Double-clicking an archive** before 1.0 always ran "Unpack & Run Game". In
  1.0 this feature was forgotten. This has been readded.
- (`FIXED`) **Checking for Updates** without a working internet connection caused the app
  to crash instantly.
- (`FIXED`) **Not having a game path selected** would cause certain features to **crash the
  app**. This includes opening "Song Explorer _(Beta)_", unpacking or updating archives, etc.
- and lastly: Squashed a few bugs here and there ~~and removed Herobrine~~.
