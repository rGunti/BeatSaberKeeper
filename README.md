# BeatSaberKeeper
BeatSaberKeeper (or "BeatKeeper" by its internal name) is a little utility program 
for the VR rythm game [BeatSaber](https://beatsaber.com/). It allows the user to
download and run multiple and older versions of BeatSaber. This is especially
useful for people who mod their games to add custom songs, adjust the UI or enjoy
custom game modes.

## Compatiblity
The current version of BeatSaberKeeper is Windows-only (using .NET Framework 4.7),
however the basic core of it is written in .NET Core 3.1, so its (theoretically)
plattform-independant.

## License
BeatSaberKeeper is covered by the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE V3.
